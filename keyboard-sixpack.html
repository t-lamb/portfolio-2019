                    This is a project for a wearables class at NYU. For this assignment we explored sound. I started thinking about instruments and how it would be fun to play an instrument on my body. I had previously made a couple keyboards using Arduino and a piezo speaker. I started thinking about how I could recreate this as a wearable.

                    I thought it would be fun to tap on my belly to produce music and then it occurred to me that I could create a six-pack of buttons that would produce different sounds. My Floridian upbringing has taught me that people love to show off their six-packs at the beach, so I imagine this instrument would be a hit at beach parties. A marketable version would be water-proof, SPF 30, and sound like steel drums.

                <h4>Fabrication</h4>
                <p>
                    I started by drawing some abs on a mannequin to make a pattern.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I cut them out of muslin and tried them on myself. Oops, this lo-fi selfie almost make them look real!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="imgs/wearables/wearables_sixpack_fab2.jpg" alt="keyboard sixpack">
                </p>
                <p>
                    I traced them onto some fusible interfacing web so I could attach the conductive fabric to some jersey fabric. I also attached conductive fabric to the muslin. These would act as the two sides on my fabric buttons.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    To make my fabric buttons I cut holes into foam and placed it in between conductive fabric. I had to resew the connections a few times, because I initially got my circuitry mixed up. I learned a lot about sewing with resistors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I soldered the piezo and some metal snaps to a breadboard so it could be removable. A future version would need to be water-proof to be safe near the ocean and pool, and at the very least have detachable parts so it could be washed.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The current version uses an Arduino Uno and has to be plugged in, but it would not be difficult to recreate it with a Flora and a battery.

                    I created a stretchy green outer layer with extra foam for more definition based on this tutorial for a <a href="https://www.u-createcrafts.com/creative-guest-homemade-muscle-suits-by/">childâ€™s Halloween costume</a>. I kinda look like a Ninja Turtle.
