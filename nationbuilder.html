                <h2>Rebranding &mdash;</h2>
                <p>In October of 2017, NationBuilder officially launched a major rebrand. The bold new logo represents community, inclusion, and the power of creation on the internet. Along with fine-tuning our branding assets, I worked for months in advance alongside our design and development team, updating the entire website and all related properties to align with our new appearance and voice. One page I really enjoyed working on was our <a href="https://nationbuilder.com/brand_resources" target="_blank">Brand Resources</a> page.</p>

                <h2>NationBuilder Stories &mdash;</h2>
                <p>NationBuilder software was designed to meet the needs of political campaigns, nonprofits and anyone with the goal of reaching and organizing large groups of people. I was the primary developer for the Stories section of the website, which showcases the diverse range of customers and their impact on the world.</p>

                <h2>NationBuilder Cities &mdash;</h2>
                <p>In concert with providing software, NationBuilder started an effort to facilitate in-person meetups for local leaders and NationBuilder customers. I worked to develop a <a href="https://nyc.nationbuilder.com/" target="_blank">template</a> for facilitators setting up new city chapters, and I co-organized and hosted our initial <a href="">NationBuilder NYC meetups</a>.</p>

                <h2>Women’s Conference &mdash;</h2>
                <p>The NationBuilder Women’s Conference is a multi-day gathering for women in leadership to discuss challenges facing women today and tell their stories of growth and persistence. I attended the first conference in Los Angeles in April 2017, and contributed my skills to support the event. I was the primary developer for the event website, facilitated a collaborative textile-arts project, and gave a speech about the history of textiles and women.</p>
