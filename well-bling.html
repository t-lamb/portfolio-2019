            <p>This is a project for a wearables class at NYU. As the first part of our assignment we made a map of our wellbeing. I noticed that my health is like a balancing act for me. I try to drink more water than coffee and alcohol. If I eat a lot of carbs and sweets, I try to follow it up with vegetables and fruit. When I work for extended periods of time, I try to fit in breaks for taking walks, reading, and knitting.</p>

            <p>During last week’s discussion Weight Watchers came up as a simplified way for people to understand nutrition. I would like to have a similar point system, but something more symbolic. While thinking about wellbeing, and attaching sensors to my body, I started thinking about how I could create a system for tracking my health that is self-actuated. I like the idea of making something that feels “off the grid” and makes me more aware of my body. I loved how ITP alum Michelle Cortese used colors with her project <a href="http://www.logmyvibe.com/">log(me)</a>.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I started thinking about Mood Rings, which I loved when I was growing up, which I realized I could produce digitally with a programmable LED. I used a Neopixel that I hooked up to three buttons, one for each Red, Green and Blue.</p>
            <p>Each color would represent a healthy activity. Pressing each button makes its color brighter and alters the overall color. Over time the colors fade, so they must be reactivated by logging healthy activities.</p>
            <div class="u-image-md">
                <img src="imgs/wearables/wearables_well-bling_process1.jpg" alt="well being bling">
            </div>
            <p>To make this wearable I needed a place to store the microcontroller, so I started looking into the design of bracelet rings. I found some really beautiful macrame designs on Etsy. This provides a convenient way to hide the hardware and wires.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">Fabrication</h2>
            <p>I chose to build mine out of felt because it’s really nice for prototyping and would be a comfortable cuff. I started by sewing 3 fabric buttons with pull-down resistors.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I chose to use an Arduino Micro, but I only had one with header pins soldered on, so I bent them and extended the pins I needed.</p>
            <div class="u-image-md">
                <img src="imgs/wearables/wearables_well-bling_process3.jpg" alt="well being bling">
            </div>
            <p>I wanted the bracelet to open easily for trouble-shooting so I added a snap that connects the buttons to power, and holds the cuff shut.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I labeled the buttons with some quick embroidery.I was not able to get this circuit to work quite right in this prototype, but here is how I imagine it to work.</p>
